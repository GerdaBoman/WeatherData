# Robo Genders Weather Project!

Welcome to Robo Genders Weather Project!

Please uplaod the excel csv file to be able to see the weather data. If you dont have sample file it has been included in the project files as TempFuktdata.csv. 

Once you have imported data all there is left is to go to weather data page and have fun! Before you start please press "Reveal" button to insert data from database into the list.  To be able to see the coldest day/ buggest humidity or which day has highest mold risk, all you need to do is to click on the column headers in main data list to be able to sort them in ascending or descening order.

To be able to see all the average information for specific day please select a date from the calender and if you would like inside or outside temperature. The result will appear in the result lsit.


Enjoy!
